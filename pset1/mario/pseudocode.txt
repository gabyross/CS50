mine:

ask height
wait for answer
while answer is > 0 && < 9
if the number is not 8, then complete it with x spaces to get that number of thinks
increase row spaces depending on the number
reverse order
printf answer with #
print every repetition of hashes in a new line
if answer is not > 0 && < 9
then ask again for height until the answer is between those parameters


theirs:

Prompt user for height
If height is less than 1 or greater than 8 (or not an integer at all), go back one step
Iterate from 1 through height:
On iteration i, print i hashes and then a newline
